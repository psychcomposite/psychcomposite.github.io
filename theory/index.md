# Theory

The theory outlines 6 dichotomies and 12 primitives that in combination aims explain complicated behavioural tendencies.
For example, a person with DF preferences are called the [Starter (DF)](/theory/categories/starter).

## Dichotomies

The dichotomies are defined as follows:

1. [Dependent (D)](/theory/primitives/dependent) vs [Neutral (N)](/theory/primitives/neutral)
2. [Stable (S)](/theory/primitives/stable) vs [Flexible (F)](/theory/primitives/flexible)
3. [Abstract (A)](/theory/primitives/abstract) vs [Literal (L)](/theory/primitives/literal)
4. [Imposing (I)](/theory/primitives/imposing) vs [Reconciling (R)](/theory/primitives/reconciling)
5. [Yielding (Y)](/theory/primitives/yielding) vs [Unique (U)](/theory/primitives/unique)
6. [Pragmatist (P)](/theory/primitives/pragmatist) vs [Moralizer (M)](/theory/primitives/moralizer)

## Personality type

For each dichotomy where a clear preference exists, we append the corresponding letter, e.g. DSAI, LSI, YP.  

Contrary to other personality systems we do not require that you have a clear preference in every dichotomy; DS is hence just as valid of a personality type as DSAIYP.

## MBTI type correlation

See the following exhaustive mapping table:

| MBTI type | PsychComposite type |
| :-------- | :------: |
| ISTJ      | NAIP |
| ISFJ      | NLIYM |
| INFJ      | NAIYM |
| INTJ      | NAIP |
| ISTP      | NLRP |
| ISFP      | NLRUM |
| INFP      | NARUM |
| INTP      | NARP |
| ESTP      | DLRP |
| ESFP      | DLRM |
| ENFP      | DARM |
| ENTP      | DARP |
| ESTJ      | DAIM |
| ESFJ      | DAIYM |
| ENFJ      | DAIYM |
| ENTJ      | DAIP |

The observant reader might notice that MBTI F-types have one more mapped primitive than MBTI T-types. MBTI FJ types have Yielding (Y) preferences while MBTI FP types have Unique (U) preferences.
MBTI/JUNGIAN typology has in fact no equivalents for the IUM (imposing, unique, moralist) or RYM (reconciling, yielding, moralist) types due to assumptions (my feelings vs their feeling) about the extraverted and introverted feeling functions.

## Jung's cognitive function correlation

Primitives can be mapped onto Jung's cognitive functions in the following way (note: not yet completely decided so may still be subject to changed):

| Cognitive function| Mapped primitives |
| :---------------- | :------: |
| Ne                | DAR  |
| Ni                | NAI  |
| Se                | DLR  |
| Si                | NLI  |
| Te                | DPI  |
| Ti                | NPR  |
| Fe                | DIYM  |
| Fi                | NRUM |

Depending on the definition of Fe and Fi, these cognitive functions may either be related to the Imposing (I) vs Reconciling (R) or Yielding (Y) vs Unique (U) dichotomies.
