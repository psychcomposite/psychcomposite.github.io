# Theory

PsychComposite outlines 6 dichotomies, 12 primitives and 3 (as of now) temperaments.
For each dichotomy where a clear preference towards a specific primitive exists, the corresponding primitive letter is included, and together they are aggregated to form a personality type, e.g. DSAI, LSI, YP. 
Contrary to other personality systems we do not require that you have a clear preference in every dichotomy; DS is hence just as valid of a personality type as DSAIYP.
When a preference in multiple dichotomies exists, the person/type is said to belong to a set of [Temperaments](/theory/temperaments).
For example, a person with DFU preferences belongs to the temperaments [Starter (DF)](/theory/temperaments/starter) and [Assertiveness (DU)](/theory/temperaments/assertiveness).

## Dichotomies

The dichotomies are defined as follows:

1. [Dependent (D)](/theory/primitives/dependent) vs [Neutral (N)](/theory/primitives/neutral)
2. [Stable (S)](/theory/primitives/stable) vs [Flexible (F)](/theory/primitives/flexible)
3. [Abstract (A)](/theory/primitives/abstract) vs [Literal (L)](/theory/primitives/literal)
4. [Imposing (I)](/theory/primitives/imposing) vs [Reconciling (R)](/theory/primitives/reconciling)
5. [Yielding (Y)](/theory/primitives/yielding) vs [Unique (U)](/theory/primitives/unique)
6. [Pragmatist (P)](/theory/primitives/pragmatist) vs [Moralizer (M)](/theory/primitives/moralizer)

## Correlations

### MBTI type

See the following exhaustive mapping table:

| MBTI type | PsychComposite type |
| :-------- | :------: |
| ISTJ      | NAIP |
| ISFJ      | NLIYM |
| INFJ      | NAIYM |
| INTJ      | NAIP |
| ISTP      | NLRP |
| ISFP      | NLRUM |
| INFP      | NARUM |
| INTP      | NARP |
| ESTP      | DLRP |
| ESFP      | DLRM |
| ENFP      | DARM |
| ENTP      | DARP |
| ESTJ      | DAIM |
| ESFJ      | DAIYM |
| ENFJ      | DAIYM |
| ENTJ      | DAIP |

The observant reader might notice that MBTI F-types have one more mapped primitive than MBTI T-types. MBTI FJ types have Yielding (Y) preferences while MBTI FP types have Unique (U) preferences.
MBTI/JUNGIAN typology has in fact no equivalents for the IUM (imposing, unique, moralist) or RYM (reconciling, yielding, moralist) types due to assumptions (my feelings vs their feeling) about the extraverted and introverted feeling functions.

### Jung's cognitive functions

Primitives can be mapped onto Jung's cognitive functions in the following way (note: not yet completely decided so may still be subject to changed):

| Cognitive function| Mapped primitives |
| :---------------- | :------: |
| Ne                | DAR  |
| Ni                | NAI  |
| Se                | DLR  |
| Si                | NLI  |
| Te                | DPI  |
| Ti                | NPR  |
| Fe                | DIYM  |
| Fi                | NRUM |

Depending on the definition of Fe and Fi, these cognitive functions may either be related to the Imposing (I) vs Reconciling (R) or Yielding (Y) vs Unique (U) dichotomies.
