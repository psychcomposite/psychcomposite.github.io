### Emotional reactivity

 Their cognitive stability allows for more stable mental representations. however, this may backfire in terms of emotional reactivity if it is the attended topic and not the distraction that is upsetting. In this case the upset will be greater with more difficulty letting go. Stable people are however generally skilled at inhibiting competing distractions unless they are so salient (read: emotionally charged) that the narrowly focused lense of attention is instead glued to the distraction, in which case the pendulum swings over with more force.
