## What is PsychComposite?

PsychComposite is a personality framework that stands out in following way:

1. The personality type is defined as a set of temperaments (usually multiple) formed from the underlying dichotomy preferences.
2. A preference on every dichotomy is not required as the person might not always lean strongly towards a particular direction (in which case it makes no sense to impose a label).
3. We presents a couple of new dichotomies that appear unprecedented in other personality frameworks.
4. All low-level traits* are justified by some associations to biology or preexisting psychological construct.
5. Although some derivations are hunch-based, unjustified assumptions are to be minimized (preferably include citations and definitely no intentionally confusing terminology).
6. There is no specific scentific process behind PsychComposite other than research and reflection.
7. Personality types in PsychComposite can be strongly correlated to other personality systems, such as the Big 5, MBTI and Jungian Typology.
8. We are open to feedback that you may submit, see [Contact & Feedback](#Contact & feedback).

## Scientific accuracy

Note that we do NOT claim that these statements are scientific or factual, although the aim is to make the framework as grounded / compatible with reality as possible.
For this reason it is not accurate to say that the framework is pseudoscientific.
We do aim for falsifiability of the framework in the Karl Popper sense of the word.

## Contact & feedback

Please send me a mail at psychcomposite@gmail.com or submit a ticket in our [github repository](https://github.com/psychcomposite/psychcomposite.github.io).
