## What is PsychComposite?

PsychComposite is a personality framework that stands out in following way:

1. The personality type is defined as a set of temperaments (usually multiple) formed from the underlying dichotomy preferences.
2. A preference on every dichotomy is not required. The person might not always lean strongly in a particular direction and in this case it makes no sense to impose a label.
3. PsychComposite presents the *Stability (S) vs Flexible (F)* and *Yielding (Y) vs Unwavering (U)* dichotomies that appears to never have been addressed directly before.
4. All low-level traits* are justified by some associations to biology or preexisting psychological construct.
5. We postulate that many behavioural tendencies (read: temperaments) can be inferred from the combination of low-level traits*.
6. All logic should be linear and straightforward to derive meaning that use of unjustified assumptions is to be minimized (no intentionally confusing terminology).
7. There is no specific scentific process behind PsychComposite other than research and reflection.
8. Personality types in PsychComposite can be strongly correlated to other personality systems, such as the Big 5, MBTI and Jungian Typology.
9. We are open to feedback.

*low-level traits = primitives

## Scientific accuracy

Note that we do NOT claim that these statements are scientific or factual, although the aim is to make the framework as grounded / compatible with reality as possible.
For this reason it is not accurate to say that the framework is pseudoscientific.
We do aim for falsifiability of the framework in the Karl Popper sense of the word.

## Feedback

Please send me a mail at psychcomposite@gmail.com.
I am happy to receive ideas for new temperaments or general feedback on the framework.
