# Cortical (C)

>High baseline cortical arousal phenotype and cognitive stability - makes for stable mental representation that resist noise, whilst risking rigidity.

## Proxies

### Neurophysiological

* Slow central COMT (e.g. rs4680 met/met)
* High DBH
* Higher cortical tonic dopamine, norepinephrine and insensitivity to phasic dopamine spikes

## Theoretical observations

### Characteristics

sustained attention to salient thoughts, intentional, hard to let go of things, prolonged and deep focus sessions, performance drops with increased stress, more comfortable doing less, insight "aha" problem solving, experiences ups and downs in life as more intense, worrier, pain sensitivity, not attracted to high risk sports
