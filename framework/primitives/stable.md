# Stable (S)

>High cognitive stability in the prefrontal cortex, leading to a propensity for uninterrupted mental representations, and a high threshold for noise to pass as signal under normal circumstances.

>Prefrontal cortical influence is marked by cognitive stability, resulting in a propensity for robust mental representations that resist noise yet with increased tendency for inappropriate rigidity in response to external signals that drive adaptive change, under normal circumstances.
    

## Linkages

### Proxies

* Slow central COMT genotype (e.g. rs4680 A-allele)
* High tonic dopamine and corresponding insensitivity to phasic dopamine spikes (prefrontal cortex)

## Theoretical observations

### Characteristics

sustained attention to salient thoughts, intentional, hard to let go of things, prolonged and deep focus sessions, at their best with no stress, more comfortable doing less, insight "aha" problem solving, experiences ups and downs in life as more intense, worrier, pain sensitivity, not attracted to high risk sports


## Assessment

| Score | Questionnaire item |
| :-----| :--------- |
| +1    | I perform worse under stress |
| +1    | I have a hard time letting go of things | 
| -1    | Some stress is just what I need to perform on exams (reversed) |
