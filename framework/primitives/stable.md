# Stable (S)

>High cognitive stability in the prefrontal cortex, leading to a propensity for uninterrupted mental representations, and a high threshold for noise to pass as signal under normal circumstances.

>Prefrontal cortical influence is marked by cognitive stability, resulting in a propensity for robust mental representations that resist noise yet with increased tendency for inappropriate rigidity in response to external signals that drive adaptive change, under normal circumstances.
    

## Linkages

### Proxies

* Slow central COMT activity (e.g. rs4680 A-allele)
* High tonic dopamine and corresponding insensitivity to phasic dopamine spikes (prefrontal cortex)

## Theoretical observations

### Characteristics

sustained attention to salient thoughts, intentional, hard to let go of things, prolonged and deep focus sessions, at their best with no stress, more comfortable doing less, insight "aha" problem solving, experiences ups and downs in life as more intense, may have been labelled HSP and/or OCD, worrier, pain sensitivity, not attracted to high risk sports

### Emotional reactivity

 Their cognitive stability allows for more stable mental representations, but this may backfire in terms of emotional reactivity if it is the attended topic and not the distraction that is upsetting. In this case the upset will be greater with more difficulty letting go. Stable people are however generally skilled at inhibiting competing distractions unless they are so salient (read: emotionally charged) that the narrowly focused lense of attention is instead glued to the distraction, in which case the pendulum swings over with more force.

## Assessment

| Score | Questionnaire item |
| :-----| :--------- |
| +1    | I perform worse under stress |
| +1    | I have a hard time letting go of things | 
| -1    | Some stress is just what I need to perform on exams (reversed) |
