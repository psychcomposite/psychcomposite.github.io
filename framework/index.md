# Framework

PsychComposite outlines 6 dichotomies, 12 primitives and several temperaments.
For each dichotomy where a clear preference towards a specific primitive exists, the corresponding primitive letter is included, and together they are aggregated to form a personality type, e.g. SKAI, LKI, BP. 
Contrary to other personality systems we do not require that you have a clear preference in every dichotomy; SC is hence just as valid of a personality type as SCAIHP.
When a preference in multiple dichotomies exists, the person/type is said to belong to a set of [Temperaments](/framework/temperaments).

## Primitives

*Definition*: A primitive is the lowest level trait description available in this framework. Either there is a preference for the primitive or there is none.
For the sake of generalizability a primitive can also be defined as a temperament with exactly one primitive.

The exhaustive list of primitives are:


| Primitive                                            | Trait description |
| :----------------------------------------------------| :--------- |
| [Stratial (S)](/framework/primitives/stratial)     | High motivation phenotype and a relatively high degree of dependence on external rewards.  |
| [Neutral (N)](/framework/primitives/neutral)         | Low motivation phenotype and a relatively low degree of dependence on external rewards. |
| [Cortical (C)](/framework/primitives/stable)           | High baseline cortical arousal phenotype and cognitive stability - makes for stable mental representation that resist noise, whilst risking rigidity. |
| [Kinetic (K)](/framework/primitives/flexible)       | Low cortical arousal phenotype and cognitive flexibility - makes for plastic mental representation that update readily, whilst risking distraction. |
| [Abstract (A)](/framework/primitives/abstract)       | Frequent or disinhibited default-mode network activity. |
| [Literal (L)](/framework/primitives/literal)         | Infrequent or supressed default-mode network activity. |
| [Imposing (I)](/framework/primitives/imposing)       | >A preference to prioritize and impose one's own internal system or worldview over adapting to external ambiguity or reconciling with differing perspectives |
| [Reconciling (R)](/framework/primitives/reconciling) | A preference to adapt to external ambiguity or reconcile with multiple perspectives over prioritizing and imposing one's own internal system or worldview. |
| [Harmonizing (H)](/framework/primitives/harmonizing)       | Tendency towards high activity of the oxytocin system. |
| [Blunt (B)](/framework/primitives/blunt)   | Tendency towards low activity of the oxytocin system. |
| [Pragmatist (P)](/framework/primitives/pragmatist)   | Tendency to adhere to cause-and-effect relationships as opposed to principled value judgements in thought and decision making. |
| [Ethicist (E)](/framework/primitives/ethicist)     | Tendency to adhere to principled value judgements as opposed to cause-and-effect relationships in thought and decision making. |

## Temperaments

*Definition*: A set of primitive preferences and an attributed description about what these preferences in combination might entail.

See [Temperaments](/framework/temperaments) for the exhaustive list.

## Dichotomies

The dichotomies are defined as follows:

1. [Stratial (S)](/framework/primitives/stratial) vs [Neutral (N)](/framework/primitives/neutral)
2. [Cortical (C)](/framework/primitives/stable) vs [Kinetic (F)](/framework/primitives/kinetic)
3. [Abstract (A)](/framework/primitives/abstract) vs [Literal (L)](/framework/primitives/literal)
4. [Imposing (I)](/framework/primitives/imposing) vs [Reconciling (R)](/framework/primitives/reconciling)
5. [Harmonizing (H)](/framework/primitives/harmonizing) vs [Blunt (B)](/framework/primitives/blunt)
6. [Pragmatist (P)](/framework/primitives/pragmatist) vs [Ethicist (E)](/framework/primitives/ethicist)
