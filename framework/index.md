# Framework

PsychComposite outlines 6 dichotomies, 12 primitives and several temperaments.
For each dichotomy where a clear preference towards a specific primitive exists, the corresponding primitive letter is included, and together they are aggregated to form a personality type, e.g. DSAI, LSI, YP. 
Contrary to other personality systems we do not require that you have a clear preference in every dichotomy; DS is hence just as valid of a personality type as DSAIYP.
When a preference in multiple dichotomies exists, the person/type is said to belong to a set of [Temperaments](/framework/temperaments).
For example, a person with DFY preferences belongs to the temperaments [Starter (DF)](/framework/temperaments/starter) and [Warmth (DY)](/framework/temperaments/warmth).

## Primitives

*Definition*: A primitive is the lowest level trait description available in this framework. Either there is a preference for the primitive or there is none.
For the sake of generalizability a primitive can also be defined as a temperament with exactly one primitive.

The exhaustive list of primitives are:


| Primitive                                            | Trait description |
| :----------------------------------------------------| :--------- |
| [Dependent (D)](/framework/primitives/dependent)     | High motivation phenotype and a relatively high degree of dependence on external rewards.  |
| [Neutral (N)](/framework/primitives/neutral)         | Low motivation phenotype and a relatively low degree of dependence on external rewards. |
| [Stable (S)](/framework/primitives/stable)           | High top-down-control, leaning towards cognitive stability. |
| [Flexible (F)](/framework/primitives/flexible)       | Low top-down-control, leaning towards cognitive flexibility. |
| [Abstract (A)](/framework/primitives/abstract)       | Frequent or disinhibited default-mode network activity. |
| [Literal (L)](/framework/primitives/literal)         | Infrequent or supressed default-mode network activity. |
| [Imposing (I)](/framework/primitives/imposing)       | Relatively high need to enforce order/structure in the outside world. |
| [Reconciling (R)](/framework/primitives/reconciling) | Relatively low need to enforce order/structure in the outside world. |
| [Yielding (Y)](/framework/primitives/yielding)       | Tendency towards high activity of the oxytocin system. |
| [Unwavering (U)](/framework/primitives/unwavering)   | Tendency towards low activity of the oxytocin system. |
| [Pragmatist (P)](/framework/primitives/pragmatist)   | Tendency to view the world through cause-and-effect relationships as opposed to value judgements. |
| [Moralizer (M)](/framework/primitives/moralizer)     | Tendency to view the world in terms of value judgements as opposed to cause-and-effect. |

## Temperaments

*Definition*: A set of primitives with an attributed description.

See [Temperaments](/framework/temperaments) for the exhaustive list.

## Dichotomies

The dichotomies are defined as follows:

1. [Dependent (D)](/framework/primitives/dependent) vs [Neutral (N)](/framework/primitives/neutral)
2. [Stable (S)](/framework/primitives/stable) vs [Flexible (F)](/framework/primitives/flexible)
3. [Abstract (A)](/framework/primitives/abstract) vs [Literal (L)](/framework/primitives/literal)
4. [Imposing (I)](/framework/primitives/imposing) vs [Reconciling (R)](/framework/primitives/reconciling)
5. [Yielding (Y)](/framework/primitives/yielding) vs [Unwavering (U)](/framework/primitives/unwavering)
6. [Pragmatist (P)](/framework/primitives/pragmatist) vs [Moralizer (M)](/framework/primitives/moralizer)
