# MBTI/JUNG

## MBTI type

See the following mapping table:

| MBTI type | PsychComposite type |
| :-------- | :------: |
| ISTJ      | NAIP |
| ISFJ      | NLIYM |
| INFJ      | NAIYM |
| INTJ      | NAIP |
| ISTP      | NLRP |
| ISFP      | NLRM |
| INFP      | NARM |
| INTP      | NARP |
| ESTP      | DLRP |
| ESFP      | DLRM |
| ENFP      | DARM |
| ENTP      | DARP |
| ESTJ      | DAIM |
| ESFJ      | DAIYM |
| ENFJ      | DAIYM |
| ENTJ      | DAIP |

Note that MBTI/JUNGIAN typology does not really have proper equivalents for IUM (imposing, unwavering, moralist) or RYM (reconciling, yielding, moralist) types due to assumptions (my feelings vs their feeling) about the introverted and extraverted feeling functions. It seems likely that high Yielding (Y) is required for Fe, but it's counterpart - Unwavering (U) - is not really needed for high Fi. That is to say that some MBTI FP types should be considered Yielding (Y) and some Unwavering (U). This preference could distinguish people-pleasing FP types from more hard-headed FP moralists.

### Resolving intratype variation with PsychComposite

The following are a couple of examples on how PsychComposite can be used to explain intratype variation:

| MBTI type variant      | PsychComposite type  |
| :----------------------| :------------------: |
| ENTP with low Fe       | DAR**U**P *(unwavering)* |
| ENTP with high Fe      | DAR**Y**P *(yielding)*   |
| ENTP, inventor subtype | D**S**ARP *(stable)*    |
| ENTP, debater subtype  | D**F**ARP *(flexible)*  |
| Fi-like ENFP           | DAR**U**P *(unwavering)* |
| Fe-like ENFP           | DAR**Y**P *(yielding)*   |


## Jungian cognitive functions

Primitives can be mapped onto the Jungian cognitive functions in the following way (note: not yet completely decided so may still be subject to changed):

| Cognitive function| Mapped primitives |
| :---------------- | :------: |
| Ne                | DAR  |
| Ni                | NAI  |
| Se                | DLR  |
| Si                | NLI  |
| Te                | DPI  |
| Ti                | NPR  |
| Fe                | DIYM  |
| Fi                | NRUM |

Depending on the definition of Fe and Fi, these cognitive functions may either be related to the Imposing (I) vs Reconciling (R) or Yielding (Y) vs Unwavering (U) dichotomies.
