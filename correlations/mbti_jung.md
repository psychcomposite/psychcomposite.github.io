# MBTI/JUNG

## How is this different from MBTI/JUNG?

The main distinctions are as follows:

1. Extraversion/Introversion dichotomy is split into two separate dichotomies: Stratial (S) vs Neutral (N) and Cortical (C) vs Kinetic (K), which refer to reward system sensitivity and cognitive stability & baseline cortical arousal, respectively.
2. Feeling/Thinking dichotomy is split into Pragmatist (P) vs Ethicist (E) and Harmonizing (H) vs Blunt (B), which clarifies confusion of how a thinker type can be nice, or how a person with strong convictions might not care about harmony.
3. Less emphasis in placed on cognition either being extraverted or introverted (e.g. extraverted judging or introverted perceiving).
4. In contrast to the Judging (J) vs Perceiving (P) dichotomy, our Imposing (I) vs Reconciling (R) dichotomy captures the relationship a person has to external ambiguity, without including aspects of conscientousness. Do you have a preference to externalize internal models (explain/decide) or internalize external information (reconcile/adapt)? Whether you are orderly or good at managing your time is not captured by this dichotomy.
5. All primitives in PsychComposite have clearcut neurophysiological correlates.


## Conversion table using MBTI sterotypes

The following table uses stereotypes of the MBTI types to account for the dichotomies that are included in PsychComposite but not the MBTI.

| MBTI | PsychComposite |
| :-------- | :------: |
| ISTJ      | NCLRBP |
| ISFJ      | NCLRHE |
| INFJ      | NCARBP |
| INTJ      | NCARHE |
| ISTP      | NKLIBP |
| ISFP      | NKLIHE |
| INTP      | NKAIBP |
| INFP      | NKAIHE |
| ESTP      | SKLRBP |
| ESFP      | SKLRHE |
| ENTP      | SKARBP |
| ENFP      | SKARHE |
| ESTJ      | SCLIBP |
| ESFJ      | SCLIHE |
| ENTJ      | SCAIBP |
| ENFJ      | SCAIHE |

## Jung's cognitive functions

Primitives can be mapped onto the Jungian cognitive functions in the following way (note: not yet completely decided so may still be subject to changed):

| Cognitive function| Mapped primitives |
| :---------------- | :------: |
| Ne                | SKA  |
| Ni                | AC  |
| Se                | SKL  |
| Si                | SCL  |
| Te                | ?  |
| Ti                | ?  |
| Fe                | ?  |
| Fi                | ? |

Depending on the definition of Fe and Fi, these cognitive functions may either be related to the Imposing (I) vs Reconciling (R) or Yielding (Y) vs Unwavering (U) dichotomies.

| Profile | Stratial DA > PFC DA | PFC DA > stratial DA |
| ------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| PsychComposite-type | Seeking (S) + Kinetic (K) | Cortical (C) |
| Jung functions | Extraverted perceiving | Introverted perceiving |
| Striatal DA | High; drives exploratory thinking and novelty seeking. | Moderate; tightly regulated by PFC. |
| PFC DA | Low baseline; seeks external stimuli. | High; enables sustained, reflective thinking. |
|DMN Activity | High; supports broad, associative ideas. | High but controlled by PFC; focused synthesis. |
|Cognitive style | Divergent, associative, outward focus. | Convergent, integrative, inward focus. |
| Overlapping psychopathology | Overinclusive thinking, ADHD, mania and schizotypy | OCD, GAD, depression and autism |

### Intuition

Observations:

* With increased stratial DA the preference might shift from Ni to Ne.
* In contrast, with increased PFC DA the preference might shift from Ne to Ni.
 

#### Extraverted Intution

>Ne = Stratial (S) + Abstract (A) + Kinetic (K)

>Ne-like individuals may start with lower baseline cortical arousal and use external stimulation (exploration, novelty, external patterns) to increase it, creating bursts of creativity and idea generation.

Characterized by cognitive flexibility, activity in the default mode network and openness to experience. A profile of high DMN activity + striatal DA > PFC DA, meaning more overinclusive thinking and positive affect mediated exploration, with comparatively little PFC inhibition.


#### Introverted Intution

>Ni = Stratial (A) + Cortical (C)

> Ni-like individuals may naturally have higher baseline cortical arousal, which facilitates their preference for introspective, sustained, and integrative thinking. They can handle deep processing without needing external stimulation to maintain focus.

Characterized by cognitive stability, activity in the default mode network and openness to experience. A profile of high DMN activity + striatal DA > PFC DA, meaning filtered idea generation with comparatively high PFC inhibition.

### Sensing

#### Extraverted Sensing

>Se = Seeking (S) + Literal (L) + Kinetic (K)

Characterized by cognitive flexibility, comparatively lower default mode network activity and lower scores on openness to experience. A profile of low DMN activity + stratial DA > PFC DA, reflecting present moment awareness, high drive and need for stimulation.

#### Introverted Sensing

>Si = Literal (L) + Cortical (C)

Characterized by cognitive stability, comparatively lower default mode network activity and lower scores on openness to experience. A profile of low DMN activity + stratial DA > PFC DA, reflecting present moment awareness and lower need for stimulation.
